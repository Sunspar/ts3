# TS3
LWRPs for installing and configuring TeamSpeak 3 servers.

## Supported Setups
In general, an OS is said to be supported if it is listed in `.kitchen.yml` under the platforms section.  
Although all supported OS and job control systems _should_ work, we test using the default systems provided by the OS (for example, systemd on Fedora 23).  

## Usage
Simply call the `ts3_install` LWRP to handle installing instances and the `ts3_configure` LWRP for configuring pre-existing instances.
