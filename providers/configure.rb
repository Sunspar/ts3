  # This is hacky, but hear me out....
  # In order for the server to operate correctly, the entire install location needs to be owned by the
  # daemon account. Due to a long standing issue with the directory resource (of which there are two camps,
  # both of which make valid arguments), the directory resource does not go into folders and files below it
  # when setting ownership, even though there is a 'recursive' field.
  #
  # As a result, we need this hacky shelling out to forcibly test each file rooted at +instal_dir+, so that
  # any changes made outside of chef don't permanently bork things. That is, running +ts3_configure :run+
  # /should/ in all cases return you to a functional server if you poke around and mess things up
  # (within reason :) )
  #
  # TODO: Find a better way to treat ownership convergence here
  #
  # See: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1621
